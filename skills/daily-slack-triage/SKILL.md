description: >
  Builds a persistent, checkable Slack Canvas digest of unresolved items from
  the past 1 day (24 hours) — public-channel @-mentions, DMs, group DMs, and
  threads Yi Jin (Eleanore, U02N4K114AK) has participated in where new activity
  has landed since her last reply. Posts / updates a single Canvas in her
  self-DM where she checks items off; next run reads the canvas first and
  skips anything already checked. Ranks by urgency (P0 / P1 / P2) then
  sub-groups by category: Pedregal launch blocker (Eradinus / Nexus / other
  platform-team deps), reliability issue, Pedregal feature gap / bug, support
  escalation, or other. The 1-day lookback applies uniformly to every category
  and every priority — nothing older than 24h enters the digest, regardless of
  urgency. Does not reply to or react on any source thread. Use when Yi Jin
  says "run my daily slack triage", "triage my slack", "what slack threads
  need my attention", "send me my slack digest", "who is waiting on me", or
  schedules this as a recurring weekday 5pm PT task.

# Daily Slack Triage

A single end-of-day **interactive Canvas** in Yi Jin's self-DM that tracks
which tagged threads still need her attention. She ticks items off inside
Slack; subsequent runs respect those checks and only surface new unresolved
activity.

## When to use

- **Recurring end-of-day check** — the intended default; scheduled weekdays
  at 5pm PT.
- **Ad-hoc catch-up** — "what did I miss today", "who's waiting on me",
  "triage my slack".

## When NOT to use

- Single-thread debriefs → use `summarize-slack-thread`.
- Weekly Pedregal status doc updates → use `pedregal-biweekly-status`.
- Drafting replies or acting inside threads — this skill is read-and-summarize
  only.

## Inputs and defaults

| Input | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Lookback window | **1 day (24 hours)** | Strict, uniform across every category and priority. Do not override. |
| Destination | Self-DM canvas titled `Daily Slack Triage — @eleanore.jin` | Re-used across runs; never create a second one |
| Run cadence | Weekdays ~5pm PT | When scheduled |
| User identity | Email `yi.jin@doordash.com` → Slack ID `U02N4K114AK` | Resolve fresh each run |

## Output format — Slack Canvas with interactive checkboxes

The digest is posted as a **Slack Canvas** (not a plain message). Canvases:

- Render `- [ ] item` and `- [x] item` as native interactive checkboxes.
- Persist across runs — Eleanore ticks boxes in Slack, and the canvas
  retains that state.
- Are re-readable via `slack_read_canvas`, which returns the current
  checked/unchecked state of every item.

**Benefit:** each run is a *diff* against the previous canvas — she never
re-sees an item she already handled.

## Workflow

### 1. Load Slack CLI

Invoke `core:using-slack` before any Slack operation. The `slack` CLI
auto-provisions via the Cowork bridge; no manual auth. If a call stalls
with `[bridge] auth` in the output, tell Yi Jin:

> "A browser window should have opened on your Mac for authentication.
> Please complete the sign-in there."

### 2. Resolve identity and locate/create the triage canvas

Get her Slack user ID (`U02N4K114AK` is the known value — verify with
`slack_read_user_profile`). Store as `$USER_ID`.

Find the existing triage canvas:

1. Search her self-DM channel for a message that contains the persistent
   canvas link. A prior run records the canvas ID at the top of a marker
   message: `"<!-- daily-slack-triage-canvas-id: F123... -->"`.
2. If no canvas exists, go to step 7 and create one. Remember to record
   its ID so future runs find it.
3. Read the canvas with `slack_read_canvas` to get the current
   checked-state map. Build a set `CHECKED = { <permalink> | row.checked }`.

### 3. Gather candidates from the last 24 hours

Compute the cutoff: `CUTOFF = now() - 24h`. Apply it to **every** source.

**a. Public-channel @-mentions**

```bash
slack slack_search_public \
  query="<@$USER_ID> after:$(date -d '1 day ago' +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  limit=20 sort=timestamp sort_dir=desc include_context=false
```

Paginate while `pagination_info` returns `cursor \`...\``. Parse the
markdown result: `### Result N of M` blocks with `Channel:`, `From:`,
`Time:`, `Message_ts:`, `Permalink:`, `Text:`. Dedupe by
`(channel_id, thread_ts)`.

**b. DMs and group DMs — `to:me` search**

```bash
slack slack_search_public_and_private \
  query="to:me after:$(date -d '1 day ago' +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  limit=20 sort=timestamp sort_dir=desc include_context=false \
  channel_types="im,mpim"
```

This returns messages **to** her. **Do not rely on this list alone** to
decide who spoke last — search omits her own replies. Collect the set of
candidate DM channel IDs only; use step 4 to verify actual latest speaker.

**c. Threads she participates in with new replies**

For channel threads where she has posted previously in the last 1 day,
read the thread and check for any message newer than her last one. Covered
implicitly by the public-channel mention search if she was @-mentioned;
explicit pass is only needed for "silent" follow-ups on threads she
started herself.

### 4. Determine actual last-speaker from full channel history

**Critical step — do NOT skip.** For each candidate:

- **Channel threads:** call `slack_read_thread` with `response_format=concise`.
  Parse the thread into an ordered message list.
- **DMs / group DMs:** call `slack_read_channel` with `limit=25` to fetch
  the last ~1 day of messages. Parse the `=== Message from NAME (ID) ===`
  blocks; sort by `Message TS` descending.

For each candidate, find `latest_non_bot_speaker`:

- If `latest_non_bot_speaker.uid == $USER_ID` → **you replied, skip**.
- If someone else is the latest non-bot speaker → **candidate stays**.

Never infer who-spoke-last from search results alone — searches for
`to:me` or `<@$USER_ID>` exclude her outbound messages, so the comparison
is one-sided.

### 5. Drop resolved, noisy, and bot-filed items

Drop candidates matching any of these patterns:

**a. Explicit resolution keywords in the last 3 messages** (any author,
not just Eleanore): `fixed`, `resolved`, `closed`, `closing`, `back up`,
`works now`, `is working now`, `seemed to work`, `seems to work`,
`rolled back`, `reverted`, `redeployed .* fix`, `thanks for (fix|resolv|help|unblock|answer)`,
`all good`, `all set`, `unblocked`, `good to go`, `ship it`,
`:white_check_mark:`, `:heavy_check_mark:`, `:tada:`, `✅`, `🎉`.

**b. Handoff / routing closure** (last message from someone other than
Eleanore contains): `Adding <!subteam^`, `Adding <@`, `routing to`,
`escalating to`, `pinging .* team`, `assigning to`, `cc'?ing for visibility`,
`handed off to`, `.* will help`, `.* can help take a look`. This means
the reroute happened — no action needed from Eleanore.

**c. Conversation migration** (any recent message contains): `let's chat
in (the )?other thread`, `continuing in <https://`, `moved to #`,
`see <https://.*> for (the )?follow-up`, `started a thread here`. If the
target thread/DM is already in the candidate set, dedupe by keeping only
the target (the newer conversation location). Otherwise drop silently.

**d. Conversational closers in DMs** — drop when the other party's last
message is only one of: `^(sure|yes|yep|yeah|ok|okay|thanks|thx|thank you|
got it|sounds good|will do|cool|nice|:+1:|:thumbsup:|:white_check_mark:)\.?!?$`
or `^ok .{0,30}(thanks|confirm|good|great).*` (e.g., "ok got it, thanks
for confirming!", "ok sounds good!").

**e. Bot-filed requests from her awaiting others** — drop openers like
`New Request from <@$USER_ID>`, `New PR Review Request from: <@$USER_ID>`
that have no replies yet (she is waiting on others, not vice versa).

**f. Passive group `cc:` messages** where Eleanore is one of several
CCs with no direct ask — regex: `^\s*cc:?\s*(<@\w+>[\s,]*)+\s*(-|-{3})?\s*$`.

**g. Previously-checked items** — if `permalink in CHECKED`, skip.

### 6. Categorize and urgency-tag the survivors

**Categories** (first match wins, top to bottom):

1. **Pedregal launch blocker** — blockers for the Pedregal product launch;
   dependencies from Eradinus, Nexus, or other platform teams; signal
   words: `blocker`, `blocking launch`, `launch dependency`, or dependency
   team names.
2. **Reliability issue** — incidents, outages, latency, error rates, SLO
   burns, cost regressions, on-call pages.
3. **Pedregal feature gap / bug** — bug reports, feature requests, or
   functional issues tied to Pedregal. Channel name contains `pedregal` or
   the thread mentions Pedregal features/screens/flows.
4. **Support escalation** — threads from `#cx-*`, `#support-*`,
   `#eng-escalations`, `#help-*`, or asks tied to customer / merchant /
   Dasher-impacting issues.
5. **Other** — anything else.

Pedregal signal words (case-insensitive): `pedregal`, `eradinus`, `nexus`
(DoorDash platform, not the general word), Pedregal launch-milestone
references.

**Urgency (P0 / P1 / P2):**

- **P0 — Urgent.** Active incident language (`down`, `outage`,
  `customers impacted`, `blocking launch`, on-call pages, `urgent`,
  `ASAP`), direct asks from senior leaders, launch blockers flagged as
  critical, cost regressions ≥$5k/day or ≥+100%.
- **P1 — Needs response today.** Important stakeholder asking a direct
  question, unresolved blockers not yet critical, threads with 2+ follow-ups
  poking for a response.
- **P2 — FYI / low urgency.** Informational tags, non-urgent questions,
  asks with no deadline.

When ambiguous, prefer the higher urgency.

### 7. Build / update the canvas

Canvas title: `Daily Slack Triage — @eleanore.jin`
Canvas format (use mrkdwn-style checkboxes — Slack canvases render these
as native interactive checkboxes):

```markdown
<!-- daily-slack-triage-canvas-id: auto-filled by first-run post -->

## 📬 Daily Slack triage — last updated <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PT>

Items in the last 24 hours where the latest non-bot message is from someone
other than you. Tick items as you handle them; next run skips anything
you've checked.

### 🚨 P0 — Urgent (N)

- [ ] **[Pedregal launch blocker]** <one-sentence summary> — #<channel> — tagged by <display name> — <🆕 | ↩️> — <slack permalink>
- [ ] ...

### ⚠️ P1 — Needs response today (N)

- [ ] **[<category>]** ...

### ℹ️ P2 — FYI / low urgency (N)

- [ ] **[<category>]** ...

---

_Previous run: <timestamp>. <K> items carried over unchecked, <M> new._
```

Within each urgency tier, order items by category:
Pedregal launch blocker → Reliability issue → Pedregal feature gap / bug →
Support escalation → Other.

Per-item fields:

- Urgency + category tag in bold brackets.
- One-sentence summary ≤120 chars.
- Channel as `#channel-name` (not ID).
- Tagger as display name (not user ID).
- Permalink preserved verbatim — this is how she jumps into the thread.
- Status glyph: `🆕` no reply yet, `↩️` new follow-up since her reply.

**Carry-over logic:** unchecked items from the previous canvas stay if
they are still within the 1-day window and still unresolved; they are
moved to the top of their urgency section and marked with a trailing
` _(carried over from <prev date>)_` note. Items that fall out of the
1-day window are removed from the canvas, checked or not.

**If the canvas already exists:** use `slack_update_canvas` with
`action=replace` and the top-level section_id to rewrite the whole body.
**Preserve** the `<!-- daily-slack-triage-canvas-id: ... -->` comment at
the top.

**If creating for the first time:** use `slack_create_canvas` targeted at
her self-DM. After it returns `canvas_id`, post a message into her self-DM
with text `"Daily triage canvas created: <canvas_url>. I'll update this in
place every run."` so she has a permalink handy.

### 8. Post / update a short "new items" DM alongside

After the canvas update, also send a **single short message** to her
self-DM summarizing what's new this run:

> `📬 Triage updated — <N_new> new items, <N_carry> carried over. Canvas: <canvas_url>`

This gives her a Slack notification; the full detail lives in the canvas.

### 9. Empty-inbox case

If the final list is zero items: update the canvas to a single line
`✅ Inbox zero — no unresolved tagged items in the last 24 hours.`
and send the short DM: `✅ Triage — inbox zero.`

## Constraints

- **1-day window is strict** — it applies to every category and every
  priority tier. A P0 from 26 hours ago does not enter the digest.
- **Never post outside her self-DM.** No replies, reactions, or messages
  in source threads.
- **Never skip step 4** — last-speaker determination must come from full
  channel history, not search results.
- **Preserve permalinks verbatim.**
- **Reuse the canvas across runs** — never create a second canvas.
- **Categorization is best-guess** — prefer the more urgent category when
  ambiguous (launch blocker > reliability > bug > support > other).

## Error handling

- Slack search returns empty across all sources → still update the canvas
  to the ✅ inbox-zero state and send the short DM.
- Canvas not found mid-run (was deleted) → create a new one, update its
  ID marker.
- Canvas update fails → fall back to posting the full digest as a regular
  message in her self-DM and flag the fallback explicitly.
- `slack_read_canvas` returns no items but the canvas exists → treat as
  empty checked-set (fresh canvas).
